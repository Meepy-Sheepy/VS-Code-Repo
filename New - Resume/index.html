        <p>
            Hello! My name is Joshua Digugno, and I transferred from Bard College, where I was majoring in Computer
            Science,
            because I realized their program wasn't the right fit for me. I've always had a passion for playing games,
            which sparked my interest in understanding
            how they're made. Over the past two years at RIT, my love for game development has only grown. I've refined
            my skills and collaborated with
            like-minded individuals on various projects. My experience at RIT has been invaluable in shaping my
            understanding of the gaming industry
            and preparing me for a career in game development.
        </p>

                            "<i>Your Journey</i>" is a game that I made for my now 3 year old niece and I wanted to make
                            an educational game for her
                            so she can learn and have fun. It is important to me that she knows that learning can be fun
                            and I hope this game will teach her that.
                            She seemed to like the prototype version of it, so I want to make more game modes about
                            ABC's, occupations/jobs, numbers, ect.

                            I wanted to try and develop one shot types of games in different genres so I can become
                            better when I make my own
                            game that would be fully developed with my own ideas. I started off with a tutorial video so
                            I can get my programming
                            juices going.

                            "<i>ChangelingVR</i>" was an intership that I took on initally as a Tech Artist but I didn't
                            really
                            like the role I was in so I switched to being a programmer and level designer for the Tween
                            level of the game.
                            I worked with 3-5 other people and we transformed the game from what was originally a
                            prototype level to a stage where
                            it can be iterated on without changing major parts. I'm pretty proud of what we managed to
                            do with such a small team.

                            "<i>With You, I'll Do Anything</i>" is a bittersweet story about a couple trying to deal
                            with a terminal illness and coming to terms with it on both sides. It's a very short
                            experience with limited choices and only 1 ending. The idea was to explore both the
                            technical side of programming choice trees but also to add a compelling narrative.

                            "<i>Everyone Is Your Enemy</i>" was a 2D Asset final project where I created all the
                            animations, backgrounds, characters, ect. The story's about a man walking in the woods who
                            suddenly gets
                            attacked by a werewolf. The enemies caught the protagonist instead of the werewolf, and now
                            he must run away
                            from whoever these people are.

                            "<i>Holding On For Deer Life</i>" is a game made back when I was a computer science major
                            at my previous college. The class was on "programming nature" and for my final project, I
                            simulated deer going to a food and water source. I added enviromental effects which are:
                            white background = no changes, blue = wind storms, brown = earthquakes.
                        </p>

                                href="https://sigmally.com/">Agar.io</a> where you are a ball and to win, you need to
                            eat all the balls and avoid the squares, otherwise you lose health and shrink. Another
                            project from my previous college.
