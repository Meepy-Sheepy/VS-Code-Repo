                <p>
                    Well, well, well...The Fall semester has started and I'm taking IGME 470: Physical Comp & Alt
                    Interfaces! Nick Buonarota is my professor for this class
                    and he's definitely made this class a lot more fun than I thought it would be. NGL, I thought this
                    class would give me the most stress, but damn!
                    I'm very excited for this class. This semester, I'll be documenting my journey into making cool
                    things with tiny things.

                    Luckily, the shipping didn't take long and I got right into opening and constructing my little guy.
                    The book is very useful and had me use the plastic
                    parts to make a foundation for the Arduino Uno and breadboard. I wasn't expecting to have to make it
                    but it does make sense. I was actually kind of
                    impressed with how much they ask you to reuse stuff. I thought once you took the pieces out, you're
                    done with it, but NOPE, you use the extra plastic
                    as the foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing that I was very happy about was the recommendation to get a plastic organizer for the
                    pieces, it was cheap and it helps with the mess.
                    But of course, because of how cheap it was, one of the hinges that opens the box broke during
                    transit! I feel like I should care more about it
                    but it's only a minor inconvenience. Overall though, constructing it wasn't too bad. It feels good to make something with your own
                    two hands--it's a different feeling from programming.
                </p>

                    So now it was time to plug this thing in and get to program something (albeit very small). What's
                    really great about Arduino is that there are pre-built
                    programs to help noobs to do understand how to upload code and see real life changes to the board!
                    So I used the Blink starter code which controls how fast the
                    light on the Uno blinks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it starts out with a delay of 1000 milliseconds which equals to 1 second. When you first plug it
                    in, it has the Blink code already uploaded to it
                    so in order to <i>actually</i> see any changes, we gotta change the delay value--so I did 1/10 of a
                    second (100 milliseconds). It's strange to see
                    that the digital space is crossing into the physical. I shouldn't feel this way because literally
                    every facet of my life is surrounded by this, but
                    when you're the one doing it, it brings a new perspective to things.

                    Okay, well that was it for Homework 0! I'm very excited to dive into electronics and hopefully I can
                    show off my projects to my family and roleplay as
                    someone smarter than I actually am! Nick has mentioned projects that meld D&D with this stuff and I
                    really want to try that. On to Homework 1: Get To Know
                    Your Tools.
