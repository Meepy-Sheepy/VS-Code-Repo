                <p>
                    Wow, wow, wow. The final chapter. Already more than half of the semester
                    has gone by and soon I'll be completely done with college!
                    I'll be graduating in the winter because of my wonky schedule and
                    transfer credits--but enough about that! Today, I'll be working on Chapter 15:
                    Hacking Buttons, where I'll be taking apart a
                    remote and controlling an LED strip with my Arduino! I'll be using a
                    new part today, called the Optocoupler. Optocouplers are intergrated circuits
                    (ICs) that allow you to control one circuit from a different
                    one without any electrical connection between the two. Inside the optocoupler is an LED and a light
                    detecter. When the LED in the optocoupler is turned on by the Arduino, the light detector
                    closes a switch internally. When the switch is closed, that means the 2 output pins inside
                    are connected, when it's open, they're not connected.
                    Using an IC like this allows you to close switches on other devices
                    without connecting them to your Arduino.

                    The build for this was fairly simple like Chapter 14. What we do first is to add the optocoupler
                    to the breadboard. Now, with the optocoupler, there are 6 pins inside and it is important which ones
                    we use. Pin 1 (top left), will be connected to digital pin 2 via a 220 ohm resistor,
                    and pin 2, is connected to ground--we have completed the loop. Then we take 2 jumper cables
                    and connect them to pin 4 and 5. Then as a part of my own spin on this project,
                    I wanted to be able to use a button to change the color of the LED, so I added a button to
                    the breadboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, we have to take apart the remote, inside there's a bunch of metal plates in a fork-like
                    pattern. This is normal to see in most remotes. We take the ends of the cables connected
                    to pins 4 and 5 and tape it to a button of choice. For me, since I'm using an LED strip,
                    I decided to tape it to the red button--that means whenever I activate my Arduino, it will
                    change the LED strip to red.

                    The code is also relatively simple too. How I wanted to do this was when I press a button, the LED
                    strip would change color. I use a switchPin variable as an output
                    and keep track of it using a switchState
                    variable. In loop(), we would constantly read the value of the
                    switchPin and store it in the switchState and by comparing
                    if the switchState has been pressed, we would send a signal to the optocoupler to connect,
                    otherwise, close the connection.

                <p>
                    Overall, this chapter feels like a good conclusionary chapter for the starter book. It holds your
                    hand the entire time up until this point where you have to explore what
                    you have around you to tinker with, which could inspire more tinkering
                    and creation beyond the book. I really enjoyed this doing this and
                    the Color Mixing Lamp still reigns as the worst assignment of all time!
