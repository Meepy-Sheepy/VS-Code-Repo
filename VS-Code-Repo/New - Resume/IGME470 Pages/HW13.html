                <h2>You Light Me Up With Only A Touch</h2>
                <p>
                    Today I'm going to be working on Chapter 13: Touchy-Feely Lamp. The idea for this project is to
                    teach me about Capacitance.
                    Capacitance is a measure of how much electrical charge something can store and for this project, I
                    will be powering an LED
                    with my own body because humans are natural capacitors (Body Capacitance). This project is very
                    simple and akin to
                    the first project where I had to power an LED with a button. Let's get to the build!

                <p>
                    The build was very easy to create. There's only a couple of wires, a resistor and an LED.
                    First we have the LED connecting to digital pin 12, then we have 2 wires
                    coming from digital pin 2 and 4 to the breadboard with a 1 megahom resistor
                    connecting the two of them. Finally, we have one long jumper wire that connects to the row pin 2 is
                    on, and the other end is extended away from the circuit,
                    not being connected anywhere else. That disconnected end will be the touch sensor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing I had to do immediately after testing it out was to use a stronger resistor. When I
                    touched the wire,
                    the LED was <b>BRIGHT</b>. I felt like I was mini-flashbanged by it and it was crazy how strong the
                    light can be. I held on it for longer to see if it would short
                    circuit but it did not thankfully. I boosted the
                    resistor to a 560 ohm resistor and it was more manageable.
                    The video you see on the right shows me touching tin foil--that
                    is optional really. Either touching the wire directly with your hand or
                    using tin foil produces the same result. I tried
                    testing out if the distance between the tinfoil and the edge of the wire
                    would make any difference on the amount of light produced but from my very quick testing,
                    it didn't seem like there was any noticeable effect.

                <p>
                    This is the entire code for this project. In order for this project to function properly, you need
                    to install a
                    library called CapacitiveSensor. This can be installed directly from the Arduino software so that's
                    nice. The variable capSensor is assigning what pin 4 and 2 do--4
                    sends to the conductive sensor material
                    through the resistor, and pin 2 is the sense pin. Next, we set up
                    a variable for the sensing threshold at
                    which the lamp will turn on and which pin the LED is connected to.
                    We make the LED an output so it can light
                    up. sensorValue is using a built-in function of the CapacitiveSensor library where it asks how many
                    samples we want to read. The more samples you ask for, the more lag may crop up,
                    the less, the more variation in the sensor. 30 is recommeneded to be the sweet spot.
                    Finally, if the sensorValue is bigger than the threshold, turn on the LED, otherwise, turn it off.

                <p>
                    Overall, I liked the simplicity of the project. One slightly off topic thing. I have a cochlear implant
                    that allows me to hear and I need to charge my battery every night. Is it possible to create an implant
                    that is charged solely by your body capacitance? I can't be the first person who thought of that
                    but I imagine that the power we give out isn't enough to power the ability to hear...or is it?
                    That would be so cool if that were to exist (even cooler in my lifetime), but I do wonder how much energy
                    it would cost to power it by your body. Would you get tired more? Just some food for thought. 10/10.
