                <h2>I'm Tweaking Out Y'all</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, I'm going to be working on Chapter 14: Tweak The Logo. These last 2 chapters are very
                    different from the rest
                    of the book. I'm now elevating my physical computation skills with more advanced topics! This one
                    works with Serial Communication. The gist of this chapter is that I will be using the Arduino
                    to communicate to my computer to send data back and forth to other applications. I will be
                    using a software called Processing which is a visual programming software and the end goal
                    is to be able to change the color of the image displayed in Processing with a potentiometer.
                    So let's get right into it!

                    The circuitry was painfully easy--it only requires a potentiometer and a couple of jumper cables to
                    connect to power, ground, and AO as the input.
                    The programming part was the meat of this project. There's really nothing more I can say on the
                    building of the circuit, so let's go to the code!

                <p>
                    Let's start with the Arduino code. In order to start serial communication, you need to write
                    Serial.begin() in start.
                    With this, you can write Serial.println() if you wanted to debug some things (which is how I used
                    it), but in this
                    case, we are going to use another function of Serial, which is Serial.write(). This allows to us to
                    send information
                    over the serial connection, in a value range of 0-255, but analog pins can read and send values from
                    0 - 1023 so we have to scale
                    it down by dividing by 4. After sending the information, we use a delay of 1/10 of a second as to
                    not overload the system and cause lag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now in Processing world, Processing doesn't automatically have serial communication capabilities so
                    we have
                    to give it that by importing processing.serial. From there, we have to create a Serial object that
                    will
                    hold the ncessessary information to process the serial connection, such as which application
                    it will be speaking to (Processing), which serial port it will communicate over (COM3), and at what
                    speed (9600 bauds).
                    We load in an image on the internet, and if there is any values coming from the port the serial
                    connection is on,
                    then we read it out and store it in bgColor which then would be applied to the hue of the
                    background, shown on line 44.

                    It was quite awesome to see interaction like that right before my eyes. It's a little freaky how
                    other human beings before me
                    figured this out, and even before that, how people thought to use rocks to make computers! Crazy
                    world we live in.
