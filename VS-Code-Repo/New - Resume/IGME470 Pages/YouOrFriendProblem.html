                <p>
                    Wow. The final project. Project 4: You Or A Friend's Problem. This has been quite
                    the journey in the introductions to physical computing and I have to say,
                    I did not expect to like it as much as I did. I was nervous, didn't
                    know the workload behind it, and I didn't know if I was going to be able to
                    do anything in this class. It proved me wrong on so many levels.
                    IGME 470 is one of the best classes I've taken at my time at RIT
                    and I wish there were more classes that delved into this sort of thing.
                    There probably is, but not for the GDD program most likely. Anyways,
                    no more sappy talk! Let's get right into it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So for the final project, I decided to upgrade what I had for Project 2: Alternative
                    Controller because of 2 reasons:
                </p>

                <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
                    <li>I really liked the idea. The gameplay felt fun and engaged cleanly with the program.</li>
                    <li>It was easier to upgrade since I wouldn't need to do the beginning stuff like
                        research or buying parts. I also had a decrease in the amount of time I had
                        to make the project because of Thanksgiving and finals time.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    So what did I do to finalize the project? Here's what I did:
                </p>

                <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
                    <li>Piezo that clicks and makes a different clicking sound when on the correct number.</li>
                    <li>Timer to see how many locks you can unlock before time runs out in Unity. Will increase time
                        successful unlock.
                    </li>
                    <li>Better visuals and feedback in Unity. Confetti when you get the correct lock number.</li>
                    <li>Button to reset the game.</li>
                    <li>Last minute addition: Sound effects of unlock curated by <i>yours truly</i></li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Everything I added made the game so much better and I'm quite proud of the result.
                </p>
