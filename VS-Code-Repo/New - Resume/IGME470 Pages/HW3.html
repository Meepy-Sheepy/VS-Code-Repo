                <h2>For The Love Of--!</h2>
                <p>
                    Today I'm doing Chapter 3: Love-O-Meter. The general vibe of the project is to use LEDs for
                    tempature sensing. Up until now, we've been very binary
                    with our LEDs, either it's on or off. Now we're going to use LEDs to get a range of temperatures
                    and depending on hot/cold the room is, none, some, or
                    all the lights will be on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're gonna use a new part, the temperature sensor to detect the temperature around me, all the
                    usual suspects of parts will also be need (i.e jumper cables
                    resistors, etc, etc.)

                    Getting into the thick of it, it was a little difficult at first to see which part was the
                    temperature sensor. It's so hard to read the label
                    when the part is black--but I found it just from comparing the shape of the image to the part. The
                    first picture on the right doesn't detail all the code
                    (it was too big) so I just took a photo of the part where the LEDs change their status (on or off).
                    Essentially, what is happening is that
                    we compare the current temperature to the baseline temperature (with some wiggle room) and if it's
                    below that, then all the LEDs are off
                    using LOW. Then it compares in between temperatures, and every time it crosses a certain threshold,
                    one more LED turns on until the temperature
                    exceeds all the prerequisites, which then at that point, all the LEDs are on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, when I turned it on, the room temperature exceeded all the comparisons! I learned this
                    afterwards, but I could've changed the baseline
                    temperature value to match my room, but what I did instead was to ice my finger for a moment and
                    touch the sensor to drastically change temperatures. To increase the temperature, I exhaled on
                    it gently.
                    I would say it worked very effectively. This is a pretty good way of debugging the temperature
                    sensor, you get to know immediatly if it responds to the
                    rapid change in the environment.

                <p>
                    The final thing I learned from this chapter was the Serial Monitor. It's basically a debug console
                    that you can print anything out to.
                    In this, we track a couple of things. The Sensor Value, I'm not entirely sure what it means. It says
                    it "<i>stores the reading from your sensor</i>."
                    Sometimes in this book I wish it told me the "what" and "why"
                    we do these things. The next one is how much power is on the pin (the math is a little strange ngl).
                    The last one shows what
                    temperature (in Celsius) is coming off of the sensor (the math is also peculiar here).

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Overall opinion? I would say maybe a 8/10 for this one. I really liked the interactivity with the
                    environment and being able to manipulate the sensor's
                    values with my own body was very cool. I dock a couple points for the explaination of what we're
                    printing out. It rushes through it and it feels
                    like its reviewing it rather than explaining it to a new person.
