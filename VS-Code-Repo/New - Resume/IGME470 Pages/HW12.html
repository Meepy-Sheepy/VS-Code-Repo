                <p>
                    Today, I'm going to be working on Chatper 12: Knock Lock. In this assignment, I won't be using any
                    new parts today, but reusing them for a different purpose! The main character is the piezo, where
                    instead of playing back sound like I did previously, I'm going to be using it as a vibration sensor.
                    I'll be able to detect how intense a knock is and be able to use that to my advantage.
                    There will be 3 states, Locked, Unlocked, Detected a Knock. These will be presented by LED's
                    and this project is a great example of how to show simple feedback to a user!

                    The construction of this circuit was not too bad. It felt like there was a lot of simple parts
                    combined to make one unique circuit. We have a couple of 220 ohm resistors for the LEDs per usual,
                    the piezo is connected to A0 because we want to be able to write data and use it. There's a servo
                    motor connected to the other side of the breaboard with a 100uF capacitor to smooth out any
                    irregularities in voltage, and finally a switch to "lock", the "box".

                <p>
                    So in this snippet of code, is most of how the knocks are being registered and how the "box"
                    unlocks.
                    knockVal is holding the value of the vibration of the knock. Next, there is an if statement where
                    if the amount of knocks registered is less than 3 and the knockVal is greater than 0 (which means
                    any amount of vibration is valid) then continue.
                    There is a function we make called checkForKnock which isn't shown on this image, but essentially
                    checks if the vibration is greater than a certain vibration
                    and less than a certain vibration. For example,
                    of the knockVal is greater than 10 but less than 100, then it would register as true. This is here
                    to be able to control what type of knocks we want to register.
                    <i>Do we want louder or quieter knocks?</i>
                    When that if statement is true, we increment the numberOfKnocks by 1.
                    When the numberOfKnocks is greater than or equal to 3, then the circuit will "unlock" the box.
                    We move the motor to 0 degrees, then we change the state of the red and green LED, and finally
                    print out that the box is unlocked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code is very readable--I thought this would be more complicated.

                <p>
                    All in all, I really liked the interactivity of this project. I mentioned this before, but the user feedback from the LEDs
                    opened my mind some more in what I could possibly do with my personal projects! 10/10 experience.
