                    Alright, so today, I'm working on Chapter 7: Keyboard Instrument. I'm going to be working with
                    Piezos again and this time
                    <i>as you can guess from the title</i>, I will be making a keyboard so let's just jump right into
                    it!

                <h2>Switchin' It Up</h2>
                <p>
                    The first thing you need to do is to make a resistor ladder. This is a way to read a number of
                    switches using the analog input.
                    For this project, we hook up 4 switches in parallel with each other and hook them up to power, with
                    most of them connecting to power through a resistor.
                    When you press each button, a different voltage level will pass to the input pin. If you press 2
                    buttons at the same time, you'll get a unique
                    input based on the relationship between the 2 resistors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the code, there are 4 different notes that the piezo can play. The notes are based on the voltage
                    read by the analog pin. So by using a couple
                    of if statements, we can play a different note based on the voltage of one or more switches! I
                    really liked learning about the resistor ladder.
                    It helps visualize how the different resistors work and how powerful they can be. I knew intuitively
                    that the more ohms on the resistor,
                    the more power it would remove from the circuit, but it was cool literally hearing the difference
                    and seeing the voltage in the Serial
                    Monitor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't mention this in HW6, but the way we make the piezo emit sound is by using this function
                    called tone(). Tone() takes 3 arguments: what pin to play the sound on, what frequency to play, and
                    how long to play the note in ms.

                    Wow. This stuff is getting pretty cool now. Everything's getting more interactive now and I'm very
                    excited for the next projects. I can see this project being used to play music with my niece.
                    I think she would love seeing this type of stuff. 9/10 for sure.
