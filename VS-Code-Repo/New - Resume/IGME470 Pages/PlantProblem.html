                    Finally! I'm done with the book and I'm off the leash now--nothing can stand in my way of me
                    pretending I'm Tony Stark in a cave with a box of scraps! Today, I will be doing the
                    "Hello World" of the physical computing world, also known as the Plant Problem.
                    The goal is to have a project where you can solve a plant problem, such as moisture level
                    tracking watering, self-watering, ect. Additionall, this is about is that
                    I have to learn the process of getting a part on the internet and create
                    something with the skills that I've procured over the 2 1/2 months!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My Plant Problem consists of a moisture sensor combined with the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and a
                    potentiometer. Overall quite the simple circuitry, but let's get <i>dig</i> in! (Get it?)

                    Now, what is a moisture sensor? Luckily, the name is what it is. It can be used to monitor soil
                    moisture levels in real-time. The capacitance of the soil moisture sensor varies
                    depending on the amount of moisture present in the soil.
                    When the soil is dry, the capacitance of the sensor is low, while when the soil is wet, the
                    capacitance is high. The sensor I have was a cheap $9 one on Amazon and it came in a 5
                    pack--a very unnecessary amount but why not right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    With those bought, I could've have the data from the sensor to output to the console in
                    the Arduino IDE, but that's lame and minimalist, so I gave myself an excuse to use the
                    LCD screen (You only use it once in the book!) to display text depending on the
                    moisture of the soil. The potentiometer is just used to change the
                    brightness of the LCD screen. The main reference for this project was Chapter 11:
                    Crystal Ball. I would say that chapter is definitely in my top 3 favorites.

                    It may be hard to read in the GIF, but here's the different
                    states the LCD can display--from Dry to Wet.
                </p>

                <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
                    <li>"I CRAVE water."</li>
                    <li>"My crave is sated. Thank."</li>
                    <li>"You can stop now father."</li>
                    <li>"I'M DROWNING!"</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    I wanted to add more text, but the LCD screen is 16x2, meaning I can
                    only have 16 characters per row and a max of 2 rows.
