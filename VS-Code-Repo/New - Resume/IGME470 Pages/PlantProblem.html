                <p>
                    Finally! I'm done with the book and I'm off the leash now--nothing can stand in my way of me
                    pretending I'm Tony Stark in a cave with a box of scraps! Today, I will be doing the
                    "Hello World" of the physical computing world, also known as the Plant Problem.
                    The goal is to have a project where you can solve a plant problem, such as moisture level
                    tracking watering, self-watering, ect. Additionally, this is about learning
                    the process of getting a part on the internet and create
                    something with the skills that I've procured over the last 2 1/2 months!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My Plant Problem is going to target the moisture level of the plant, as to not over
                    or under-water the plant. The parts I need consists of a moisture sensor
                    combined with the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and a
                    potentiometer. Overall quite the simple circuitry, but let's get <i>dig</i> in! (Get it?)

                    Now, what is a moisture sensor? Luckily, the name is what it is. It can be used to monitor soil
                    moisture levels in real-time. The capacitance of the soil moisture sensor varies
                    depending on the amount of moisture present in the soil.
                    When the soil is dry, the capacitance of the sensor is low, while when the soil is wet, the
                    capacitance is high. The sensor I have was a cheap $9 one on Amazon and it came in a 5
                    pack--a very unnecessary amount but why not right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    With those bought, I could've have the data from the sensor to output to the console in
                    the Arduino IDE, but that's lame and minimalist, so I gave myself an excuse to use the
                    LCD screen (You only use it once in the book!) to display text depending on the
                    moisture of the soil. The potentiometer is just used to change the
                    brightness of the LCD screen. The main reference for this project was Chapter 11:
                    Crystal Ball. I would say that chapter is definitely in my top 3 favorites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may be hard to read in the GIF, but here's the different
                    states the LCD can display--from Dry to Wet.
                </p>

                <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
                    <li>"I CRAVE water."</li>
                    <li>"My crave is sated. Thank."</li>
                    <li>"You can stop now father."</li>
                    <li>"I'M DROWNING!"</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    I wanted to add more text--adding father in all the dialogue options,
                    but the LCD screen is 16x2, meaning I can
                    only have 16 characters per row and a max of 2 rows.

                <h2>Code</h2>
                <p>
                    While the circuitry was simple, the code was also very simple. Since my project
                    revolves around the modification of the Crystal Ball project, all I really needed
                    was 2 variables:
                </p>

                <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
                    <li>moisturePin - The pin where the moisture sensor is connected to.</li>
                    <li>moistureVal - The value that the moisture sensor is outputting based on the moisture level.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    In Loop(), I read the moisturePin's values and assign them to the moistureVal.
                    The next thing is getting those values and printing out a state depending on the moisture level.
                    This is where the if statements come in. When initially testing the values, it had this
                    weird range from ~469 to ~234. I tried to map the values to a 0 to 235 (the difference of those
                    2 values), but it didn't work the way I wanted it to so I had to use the raw values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After reseaching the plant I got for 5 bucks at a RIT vender, it was a jade plant. They
                    are very easy to maintain and don't require watering until the top 2 inches
                    of soil is completely dry but it can be a problem if they're overwatered.
                    So I guessimated some values to align with the needs
                    of this plant by having a low range of craving water, a big range of the sated state, and
                    a mid-range of being overwatered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This was a very good stepping stone for getting outside of the book. The moisture sensor
                    is the perfect item to buy since there's not many things you can do wrong with them.
                    Each time I complete a project, I feel more and more confident that I can do
                    a bigger thing next time. This class is paced very well in my opinion
                    and structured amazingly!
