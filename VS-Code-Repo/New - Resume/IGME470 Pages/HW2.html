                <h2>Going To Space</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, I'm going to be doing Chapter 2: Spaceship Interface, where I will be building a "control
                    panel" with a switch and lights.
                    This is to emulate like firing lasers when I press the button. At this point, putting in the power
                    and ground cables, making a circuit is pretty
                    simple, but now I'm using the digital pins to connect the power to the LEDs. I really like how each
                    chapter easily builds on each other and
                    playing with cables is very fun!

                <h2>Oh My God Lasers</h2>
                <p>
                    So I thought this homework assignment would be easy peasy lemon squeezy but it turned out to be oh
                    so wrong! I had been using the wrong resistors the entire time. When I tried to fix the problem by
                    switching them
                    out, I found myself wondering which resistors were
                    which. In order for me to finally figure this out, I just used the strips and mathed them out.
                    Finally I discovered that this entire time I was using
                    the 10Kohm resistor instead of the 220ohms. This took maybe at least 30 minutes and I was utterly
                    confused this entire time. But luckily now,
                    I know how to figure out what type they are. If colors fail, math previals!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I finally got it to work, it was very cool seeing how using the digital pins interacted with
                    the code. Using the lights as OUTPUTS to be able to
                    turn them on and off and the button as an INPUT definitely gives me more of an understanding of how
                    physical parts speak to code. By being able to write to the pins, you're able to either set them to
                    HIGH or LOW to either turn them on or off,
                    which is shown in the gif to the right. THIS IS SO COOL.

                <h2>Houston, We Have A Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    In my previous blogs, I mentioned that I use both the book and the tutorial video as a way to learn
                    the most that I can.
                    When I finished the book chapter, the video told me to do a challenge: To use another green LED and
                    have that flicker when the button isn't
                    pressed. Using the flickering code for the red lights, it was pretty easy to
                    implement it for this new LED. I also had to use another jumper cable
                    to connect a digital pin to the power of the LED,
                    all without the help of the book so I felt like a boss.

                <p>
                    Well that was a very eventful project. Learned a lot more about resistors, and did an extra challenge! I should try for future ones
                    to make my own challenge to really boost my skills, but I would need to plan my week out more in order for that to happen. This class isn't hard
                    but it is VERY time consuming. Lock in perhaps?
