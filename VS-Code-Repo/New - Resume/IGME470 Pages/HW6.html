                <h2>Making Some Noise</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, I'm going to be working on Chapter 6: Light Theremin. If you don't know what a Theremin is,
                    neither did I! It's apparently an instrument
                    that makes sounds based on the movements of a musician's hands around the instrument. The Theremin
                    detects where a performer's hands are in relation
                    to 2 antennas by reading the capacitive change on the antennas. Kinda weird and it was made in
                    1928--way farther back than I thought it would be.

                <p>
                    How this works for this project though is instead of using the movements of hands, I'm going to be
                    using light. By using a phototransistor,
                    I can detect amount of light that passes through the phototransistor and change the amount of
                    light by waving my hand over it.
                    The amount of light will determine the voltage on the analog pin, which will
                    in turn determine what frequency note to play.

                <h2>Piezo Pleasantries</h2>
                <p>
                    Thankfully, the build didn't take too long. There were very little parts that I had to add for this
                    project to work.
                    A new part that I added is a piezo. A piezo is a small element that vibrates when it receives
                    electricity. When it moves,
                    it displaces the air around it, creating sound waves.
                    What's cool about the piezo is that it can be either polarized or non-polarized. This one was
                    non-polarized so I didn't need
                    to worry about which leg was for ground or power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To explain the BTS of the project, at the beginning it detects the light around it for 5 seconds,
                    sensing the highs and lows of the light around it.
                    After that, we read out the phototransistor's values, map its voltage (0 - 1023) to pitch
                    (50 - 4000), finally we assign pitch to the piezo and then we have sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I got it to work, it was very grating. Like not very pleasant to listen to. However,I changed
                    the delay from 10 ms to 100ms and
                    it became kinda a bop.

                    What a relatively simple, yet fun project to work on! I can sense the possibilites with this. You
                    can build your own alarm clock
                    or even better...a device to jump scare your friends once they turn on the light in a room and it
                    just screams. I think I just cooked there. 9.5/10 experience.
