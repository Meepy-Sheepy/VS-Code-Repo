                <h2>Keeping Track Of Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, I'm going to be working on Chapter 8: Digital Hourglass. You know when you have a regular
                    hourglass that has sand inside of it and
                    you flip it around to restart the timer? I'm going to be doing that but digitally! With LEDs!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of using sand to track the time, I'm going to use LEDs. As the time increases, the amount of
                    LEDs that are on will increase.
                    For example, if 20 seconds has passed and I wanted an LED to light up every 10 seconds, then 2 LEDs
                    would be on. Enough chatter, let's get
                    right into it!

                    The circuitry is actually kind of basic. It's very similar to Chapter 1, where I just used 1 LED to turn it on. I put in 6 LEDs, each of them
                    representing 1 second. These are our outputs. The new item for this chapter is the tilt sensor. The tilt sensor is like a regular switch with an
                    on/off sensor, but instead there is a tiny ball inside it that detects orientation. So when we tilt it, it knows that it has been moved. The tilt
                    sensor is our input. I'm going to be using the data from the tilt sensor to be able to reset the LEDs and timer.

                <h2>Code</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's a small preview of what the code looks like. Essentially, what we do in this code is keep track of the current time using
                    the millis() function which is stored in a unsigned long value of "currentTime". The use of Unsigned and Long allows us to be able
                    to count up to 4,294,967,295 milliseconds, which is almost equivalent to 50 days. We then check to see if the time passed is
                    greater than the interval (in this case 1 second), then another LED turns on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, in the original project, there was nothing within the  "if led > 8" statement, so in order to challenge myself
                    I decided to take the piezo that I used last time and create my own alarm clock! In that code snippet, I keep the
                    LED at 8 just so it doesn't continously increase for no reason and I use the tone() function to make noise.
                    The 9 is which pin is plugged into, the note is what frequency it will play at, and it will play for half a second.

                    I think this was my favorite one so far. It was very easy to digest and I made something that can be used by people
                    if they <i>really</i> wanted to. Being able to see real life application of the stuff I'm making
                    is making me fired up and excited for when I make my own things for the projects that are coming up!
