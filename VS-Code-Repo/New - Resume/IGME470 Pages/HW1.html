                    Okay! So now we're finally getting into the nitty gritty of this course. Today, I'm using a button to try and turn on an LED. Should be pretty simple right?
                    Well, it <i>technically</i> was, but wow, are there a lot of new terms. Transducers? Sensors? Actuators? It's a little hard to picture what it actually means
                    but I'm sure in time, it will click. There's also Voltage, Current, and Resistance, which make more sense to me but still in the nebulous region for now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  BUT, it is time finally make something happen! I followed the video and read the chapter at the same time so I didn't fully depend on either source. Both
                  medias combined gave me a more in-depth tutorial on how to make my first circuit.

                <p>
                    To make my first circuit, all I needed was an LED, resistor, switch, and a couple of jumper cables. All in all, it was pretty simple and figuring out
                    how Power and Ground work together and the path that is required in order to make the LED light up is starting to make some sense. LED's are
                    polarized components, which means they only allow electricity to flow through them in one direction. There are 2 legs on the LED, an anode and cathode.
                    Anode, the longer leg connects to Power while Cathode, the shorter leg, connects to Ground.
