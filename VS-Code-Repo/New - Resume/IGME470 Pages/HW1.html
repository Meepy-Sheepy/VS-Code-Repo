                <p>
                    Okay! So now we're finally getting into the nitty gritty of this course. Today, I'm using a button
                    to try and turn on an LED. Should be pretty simple right?
                    Well, it <i>technically</i> was, but wow, are there a lot of new terms. Transducers? Sensors?
                    Actuators? It's a little hard to picture what it actually means
                    but I'm sure in time, it will click. There's also Voltage, Current, and Resistance, which make more
                    sense to me but still in the nebulous region for now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BUT, it is time finally make something happen! I followed the video and read the chapter at the same
                    time so I didn't fully depend on either source. Both
                    medias combined gave me a more in-depth tutorial on how to make my first circuit.

                <p>
                    To make my first circuit, all I needed was an LED, resistor, switch, and a couple of jumper cables.
                    All in all, it was pretty simple and figuring out
                    how Power and Ground work together and the path that is required in order to make the LED light up
                    is starting to make some sense. LEDs are
                    polarized components, which means they only allow electricity to flow through them in one direction.
                    There are 2 legs on the LED, an anode and cathode.
                    Anode, the longer leg connects to Power while Cathode, the shorter leg, connects to Ground.

                <h2>Series Circuits</h2>
                <p>
                    After I did the first circuit, the book suggested I do Series Circuits. In this scenario, I would be
                    adding another switch to the equation.
                    Series mean that the same electrical current flows through both switches, meaning that they have to
                    both be pressed in order for the LED to light up. I think of this as an AND statement in
                    programming. A and B need to be TRUE in order for the
                    LED to light up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a pretty cool exercise as I further understood how connection and flow of electricity
                    works. One thing that keeps tripping me up is
                    how connected the wires are to the breadboard. I've had some connectivity issues and I'm hesistant
                    to put pressure on this seemingly fragile object.
                    I did SPEND 80 bucks on this thing!

        <!-- Parallel Circuit SECTION -->
        <div class="blog-post">
            <div class="text">
                <h2>Parallel Circuits</h2>
                <p>
                    Finally, the last thing Chapter 1 wanted me to try was Parallel Circuits. This one is very similar
                    to the Series one but instead of having to press
                    both buttons in order for the LED to light up, you can press either one. This is very similar to an
                    OR statement, where either A OR B can be true
                    for the LED to light up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where my understanding of connectivity finally solidified. Using a jumper cable, we connect
                    the top most button to the LED and for the bottom button
                    we keep the same jumper cable as it already connected to the LED. We essentially skip over the
                    second connection with the switch, making the
                    circuit a Parallel.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    I would say that Chapter 1 went pretty smoothly but there were some problems I encountered. Knowing
                    which resistor to use was a little confusing.
                    The book suggested I read page 41 for more information on it and while that did explain some things,
                    finding which one was the 220 OHM resistor was still
                    difficult. The only way I found it was the video tutorial and the images on all the resistors on
                    page 41.
                    The Breadboard was annoying at times--not knowing how far I should insert the cables and LED led to
                    insecurity on how I should properly handle cables. I wish the Arduino products considered showing
                    feedback to the user, like if a cable is connected to
                    Power/Ground or if the LED is fully inserted it would make a *click* sound or something along those
                    lines. Overall, Arduino, as it stands, is a really good
                    starter for people that never done anything with wires and
                    electronics.
