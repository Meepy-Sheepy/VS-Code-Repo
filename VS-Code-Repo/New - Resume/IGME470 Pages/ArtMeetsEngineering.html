                <h2>Birthday or Death Day?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yello, Hello! Today, I'm going to be working on Project 3: Art Meets Engineering.
                    In this project, I was assigned to make something that combines artistry
                    with the Arduino. For example, one could make an etch-a-sketch
                    using a potentiometer and the Processing software as a canvas. However,
                    I decided to go more <i>experimental</i> with it. When thinking up an idea
                    for this project, I wanted to make something that had an underlying meaning
                    to it. Like there's something more that meets the eye. So I came up with
                    <i>Birthday</i>. I have this running "joke" whenever it's someone's birthday
                    where I congratulate them on being one year closer to their death. And so
                    sparked my idea for Project 3, a morbid, dark humor-esque game where you
                    have to blow on a candle, increasing in age, but there is a timer
                    that continuously ticks down. If the timer goes to 0, you're dead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The parts I use are very simple: an LED to detect whenever a candle has been "blown",
                    3 jumper wires connected to power, the anode of the LED, the cathode of the LED to
                    digital Pin 5, 220 ohm resistor, and tin foil and paper to
                    make a paper candle and extend the contact range with the tin foil.

                <p>
                    The process of Project 3 was a little weird at first. I didn't
                    really know how to make what I wanted. Do I need a wind
                    sensor? Can the Piezo work for this? How much money
                    do I need to invest in this? When looking on Amazon
                    for wind sensor parts, nothing caught my eye. So,
                    I went to Nick, my professor for help.

                </p>
                <p>
                    He cleared everthing up! Instead of being really fancy with it,
                    I could use 2 wires that would make a connection and find a way to
                    get the data from the connection to make my project.
                    The circuitry was a little weird to conjure in my head,
                    even though I knew I had done it before, but Nick
                    suggested to look at Project 2: Spaceship Interface to see how to
                    be able to detect if the candle connection was valid. From there,
                    it was not difficult because I was very familiar with the other parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the circuitry was not too difficult, I wanted to spruce up the
                    interface players would be interacting with. I used Unity once
                    again to make this the way I wanted to. Players need to know 2 things:
                    how much time they have left, and what age they are. So I put those
                    on the screen at all times. However, the <i>feeling</i> wasn't there.
                    It didn't feel like a birthday party so I added balloons and candles
                    to get that happy feeling. Now that we have those components
                    in place, having the "Death" timer surrounded by a bunch balloons
                    and celebratory decorations, the dichotomous feelings are now established.

                <h2>Arduino Code</h2>
                <p>
                    The process was very similar to Project 2. I really enjoyed being able to serial communicate
                    with other programs, so I wanted to do that again. As a GDD major, gamifying concepts
                    is just what I like to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code for the Arduino is very short. The LED that has a cable connected to the cathode
                    which connects to digital Pin 5 on the UNO. The way this works is that there is a
                    1 cable connected to power and another connected the anode of the LED. When the
                    2 cables connect, the LED lights up and the resistor that connects to ground
                    makes a viable circuit. The 3rd cable connects to the LED's cathode, which
                    allows me to be able to detect when the connection has been made and
                    from there I can use the data to my advantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    blowState reads in the data collected from the LED and if the LED has been
                    turned on and the previousBlowState was off, then it will print out
                    the word BLOW to the serial console once. I want it to be once because
                    for my project, the age of the player goes up by one. If it wasn't
                    there, then it would print multiple BLOWs to the console, therefore,
                    increasing the age by a lot more than 1. Even then, 2 to 3
                    BLOWs still printed, so the delay(100) guarantees only 1 BLOW.
                </p>

                <h2>Unity Code</h2>
                <p>
                    This code is also similar to Project 2. There are 3 main variables to keep track of:
                </p>
                <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
                    <li>age - The age of the player.</li>
                    <li>deathTimer - The timer that leads to the player's inevitable death.</li>
                    <li>isTimerRunning - Boolean to track timer</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The first chunk of code just detects if it reads in the string "BLOW", and if it does, increase
                    the age of the player and deathTimer by 1. Why increase the deathTimer you might ask?
                    Well, to make the game more playable obviously! It's not necessarily fun if no matter what you
                    do, you die (even though that is the case IRL). It makes it more challenging and players will want
                    to see how far they can go without dying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next chunk is keeping track of the timer and updating the text on screen. While the deathTimer
                    is greater than 0, just keep decrementing it by the time, if it does cross over to the negatives,
                    then just return false on the isTimerRunning boolean (which stops the timer), and keep the
                    timer at 0. When the isTimerRunning is false, change the text to the "game over" text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's been a long road since the start of the semester. I've really enjoyed what I've done in this
                    class. This project was fun to make and the idea is very provocative!
                    It's time to move onto the last project...
