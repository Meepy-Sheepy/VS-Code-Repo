                <h2>Birthday or Death Day?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yello, Hello! Today, I'm going to be working on Project 3: Art Meets Engineering.
                    In this project, I was assigned to make something that combines the artistry and
                    creativity with the Arduino. For example, one could make an etch-a-sketch
                    using a potentiometer and the Processing software as a canvas. However,
                    I decided to go more <i>experimental</i> with it. When thinking up an idea
                    for this project, I wanted to make something that had an underlying meaning
                    to it. Like there's something more that meets the eye. So I came up with
                    <i>Birthday</i>. I have this running "joke" whenever it's someone's birthday
                    where I congratulate them on being one year closer to their death. And so
                    sparked my idea for Project 3, a morbid, dark humor-esque game where you
                    have to blow on a candle, increasing in age, but there is a timer
                    that continuously ticks down. If the timer goes to 0, you're dead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The parts I use are very simple: an LED to detect whenever a candle has been "blown",
                    3 jumper wires connected to power, the anode of the LED, the cathode of the LED to
                    digital Pin 5, 220 ohm resistor, and tin foil and paper to
                    make a paper candle and extend the contact range with the tin foil.

                <h2>Arduino Code</h2>
                <p>
                    The process was very similar to Project 2. I really enjoyed being able to serial communicate
                    with other programs, so I wanted to do that again. As a GDD major, gamifying concepts
                    is just what I like to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code for the Arduino is very short. The LED that has a cable connected to the cathode
                    which connects to digital Pin 5 on the UNO. The way this works is that there is a
                    1 cable connected to power and another connected the anode of the LED. When the
                    2 cables connect, the LED lights up and the resistor that connects to ground
                    makes a viable circuit. The 3rd cable connects to the LED's cathode, which
                    allows me to be able to detect when the connection has been made and
                    from there I can use the data to my advantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    blowState reads in the data collected from the LED and if the LED has been
                    turned on and if the previousBlowState was off, then it will print out
                    the word BLOW to the serial console.
