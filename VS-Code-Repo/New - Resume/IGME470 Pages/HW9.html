                <p>
                    Up next, I'm doing Chapter 9: Motorized Pinwheel in the starter Arduino book--and this is where it
                    gets
                    a <i>little bit more complicated</i>. For this exercise, I'm going to be managing 2 different power
                    sources:
                    the 5V from the Arduino microcontroller, and a 9V battery. The reason why I need a 9V battery is
                    because
                    the motor cannot run on 5V. It needs a little more juice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's dive into the nitty gritty.

                <h2>The Nitty Gritty</h2>
                <p>
                    There's 2 new things other than the motor and battery I'm introduced to: Transistors and Diodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Transistors are components that allow you to control high current and high voltage power sources
                    from the low
                    current output of the Arduino. They're like digital switches in a way--like when you provide voltage
                    to one of the pins known as a gate,
                    it closes the circuit between the other 2 pins, called the source and drain.
                    We can turn a higher current/voltage motor on and off with your Arduino.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I techncally know about diodes right now. LEDs are considered diodes, where currents can only go
                    one way. However, this diode I'm using is to be able to prevent back-voltage coming from the motor
                    when the motor is still running even when I do not press the button. I put it in the reverse of the
                    circuit, that means, the negative (or cathode) connects
                    the power of the motor while the positive (anode)
                    connects to the ground of the motor.

                <p>
                    I will say that this chapter was a little complicated, but I understood the gist of it.
                    It seems like I will be working with the motor more so hopefully by then, I will understand more of it.
