                <h2>Going Round--Actually Only 180</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, I'm going to be doing Chapter 5: Mood Cue, and this one <i>really</i> caught my eye as now
                    I'm using motors! The objective of
                    this chapter is to use a servo motor which has a motor arm attached and use what's called a
                    potentiometer to rotate the arm.
                    The way we achieve this is similar to the PWM from the last chapter. Servo motors expect a number of
                    pulses that tell them what angle to
                    move to. We use a built in library to be able to easily control the motor. Since the analog input
                    goes from 0-1023, we need to translate the values
                    from the potentiometer to degrees, by using the map() function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was very hyped to do this project and got great results!

                <p>
                    The build went pretty smoothly and I learned about capacitators which "smooth" out any voltage
                    changes that may occur during the run time.
                    These capacitators were a little scary because the book just casually says it could blow up if the
                    anode and cathode were placed
                    wrong! When I got it working, I was shocked. It's one thing for a light to blink and change colors,
                    but it's
                    a whole other feeling when you see something <i>move</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One problem I did run into was using the male header pins and trying to plug them into the end of
                    the servo motor.
                    The white clip that has 3 colored wires attached to it, requires the male header pins to be able to
                    connect to the breadboard and when trying to put them on the clip, it wouldn't stick on too well.
                    I had to do some forcing to get it to stay but other than some temporary finger pain, it was fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of the clip, there are 3 different colored wires, red = power, black = ground, and
                    white = serial connection. The first 2 are self-explanatory, the white is how we get the motor to
                    move by the potentiometer.
                    In the code, we need to access which pin the motor is attached to on the microcontroller (in this
                    case is pin 9). Once we have that information,
                    we can take the values from the potentiometer, convert them to 0-179 degrees, apply the angles
                    to the motor, and viola! We have a moving motor. The little motor arm reminds me of the little robot
                    that passes butter in Rick And Morty. It's so tiny!

                    Overall, I really liked this chapter. It was new, fun, not too difficult, and I learned more
                    electrical parts. Hopefully no parts explode in the near future!
