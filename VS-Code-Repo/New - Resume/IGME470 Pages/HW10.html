                <p>
                    Today, I'm going to be doing Chapter 10: Zoetrope. A Zoetrope was an invention before the internet,
                    or even before movies existed, that allowed
                    people to create the first moving images. Zoetropes create the illusion of motion from a group of
                    still images that have small changes in them.
                    They're typically cylinders with slits cut in the side. When the cylinder spins and you look through
                    the slits, you perceive the still images
                    to be animated. For this assignment, I'm not going to create the cylinders as that takes some more
                    "doing" and I am a busy college student!
                    So the main meat of this project is to be able to turn it on and off, change the speed of the motor,
                    and be able to reverse the direction
                    of the motor--so let's do that!

                    This was a decently complex circuit I had to make. I used this new item called and H-Bridge, which
                    are a type of component known as integrated
                    circuits (IC). ICs are components that hold large circuits in a tiny package. It makes things a lot
                    easier to manage and if you wanted to make your
                    own H-Bridge, you would probably need another breadboard. <i>It's that complex.</i> It's a lot to
                    take in and the book doesn't tell you very easily
                    what your plugging wires into. So Nick (my professor) suggested I look on the Arduino starter kit
                    website to see the schematic for every piece in
                    the set and I looked at the H-Bridge one. Look below to see the schematic. It's definitely a lot
                    easier to understand it now.

                    There's this really annoying problem everytime I use the 9V battery and it's that it doesn't lock
                    into the breadboard well (or at all for that matter). There were several instances where if I needed
                    to move my breadboard, the wires would easily just fall out of the holes. I've had more success with
                    it when I connect perpendicular to it, then once the end is in the hole, to bend the cable 90
                    degrees.

                    The code isn't too bad. First we need to read the on/off and direction switch to see if we need to
                    turn on the motor or not or change the direction. The potPin is the potentiometer. We divide it by 4
                    in order to get a range from 0-255 (1023/4). The first if statement is just saying that if
                    we press a button, and the switch is on, then we want to inverse the state of the motor.
                    The second if statement is only different in the fact that it's the direction.

                    This chapter was a fine one. It was for sure better than the Color Mixing Lamp. 8/10.
