                <p>
                    Today, I'm doing Chapter 11: Crystal Ball. In this assignment, I will use a new component called a
                    Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).
                    This item can diplay text and like a magic 8 ball, we are going to be able to ask it a question,
                    shake it, and a random response
                    will show up on the LCD. So let's get right into it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Also I forgot to take a setup picture so here's a picture of a family of deer chilling by the
                        river.</i>

                <h2>Who's The Most Wired Of Them All?</h2>
                <p>
                    The overall build wasn't that bad--just a lot of wires to plug in. One weird thing that I found was
                    that the labels on my
                    LCD does not match some of the ones in the book. Like VCC was VDD, but it still worked the same.
                    Quite strange.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The way this works is that at the start of the code, it sets the text for the LCD to the "welcome"
                    state but when you shake it,
                    the tilt sensor will sense a change to its state and then pick a random number from 0-7 and sets the
                    text depending on what that
                    number would set it to. I'll explain more about that in the code portion but that's pretty much it,
                    the only complex part of this
                    project is to know which wire goes to where in the LCD. There's a lot of inputs to it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    One input is the RS or the Register Select pin. This controls where the character will appear on
                    screen. Another one is R/W which stands for Read/Write and we
                    connect this to ground which means we can
                    write to it. There are 2 pins that are very similar, Vcc and LED+/-.
                    After testing this out in Tinkercad,
                    I found out that the Vcc powers the text that shows up on screen, while being directly powered
                    to 5V. The LED+/- powers the screen, or the background for the text,
                    and this, needs a resistor for the power. It was kinda cool seeing that in Tinkercad.
                    <i>To be honest, I haven't been testing much out in it because I didn't feel like I needed to.</i>
                    But I had it up so I just thought I try it out!

                <p>
                    Just liked I explained above, we read in the tilt value. 0 for if it's still,
                    1 for if it moved. If it does move, the reply variable holds a random value (0 - 7).
                    "lcd" is an external library which allows us to manipulate the LCD. So we first erase
                    what's on the screen, then set cursor to (0, 0), which is the top left corner, add some text, then
                    send the cursor to (0, 1), which is the bottom left corner.
                    Think of it like entering in a document where you go down a line. Finally,
                    a switch case is used to go through the range of numbers. If reply, for example, held the value 2,
                    it would print on the second line, "Certainly."

                <p>
                    I very much enjoyed this assignment. Asking it funny questions and getting an equally or more funny
                    response was very fun
                    and just using screens like this is very cool. 10/10 experience.
