                <p>
                    Today I'm going to be working on Chapter 4: Color Mixing Lamp. Essentially what I'm doing is
                    manipulating what color a special LED (Common Cathode RGB LED) is going to emit. I'll be using a new
                    technique known as Pulse
                    Width Modulation (PWM) to fade LEDs.
                    PWM rapidly turns the output pin high and low over a fixed period of time. So using phototransistors
                    (components that generate a current
                    proportional to quanitity of light absorbed), I'll be able to change the LED's color based on how
                    much light is being absorbed by any of the phototransistors.
                </p>

                    Before I dive right into the project, I needed to organize the resistors. Most of them were still
                    held on by tape and once I took one out, I can't really tape it back, so I got some bags from
                    Wegmans and put each type of resistor in their own
                    bag with a little paper labeling what type it is. Normally, I would use green tape and label it that
                    way, but I didn't have it so that was the next
                    best thing. Finally, it looks so much better in the plastic organizer and it takes a lot less time
                    figuring out which resistor is which.

                <h2>The Start</h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time the book told me to use phototransistors and to put each leg on either side
                    of the breadboard. It was a weird
                    thing to tell me to do, but from my understanding, I think it's mainly used to spread the parts out
                    evenly so it's more readable and
                    prevent overlap. It does look more professional and cooler, so I'm going to try and keep doing that.

                <h2>The Horror Of This HW</h2>
                <p>
                    Okay...well I did finish the project but not without some nails being pulled out and my hair
                    withering. It took such willpower to not throw my
                    80 dollar Arduino set out the window. So here's the tea: Basically, these phototransistors are
                    inside these yellow bricks. The yellow bricks
                    have slits which allows the gel to stay on and wrap around the phototransistors. This gel are in
                    colors red, green, and blue and when one is wrapped
                    around a phototransistor, it absorbs the color and translates it to the common cathode RBG LED. The
                    gel, was the culprit of my anguish--it kept popping out of the
                    slits and making my day worse. The yellow bricks also were annoying. Since the phototransistors
                    don't keep the bricks in place, they slowly fall down
                    and if you're fiddling with a gel, any of the yellow bricks would fall down, causing MORE gels to
                    pop out. Terribly designed I might say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I did get it working though, it was very cool seeing how the phototransistors translated data
                    to the RGB LED. It's strange to see how
                    it's just 0's and 1's at the end of the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    P.S. It's hard to tell in the photo, but the colors do change a lot more what is shown.

                <p>
                    I'm not sure how I would use this in other projects. The setup itself is very finnicky and left much
                    to be desired. Maybe if you wanted a lamp
                    that changed color throughout the day, that could be a cool side project. Overall, not a great
                    experience. Hopefully this was the worst of the worst and things can only go up from here!
